Streams Read file:
If you see FS-Sync.js file, it has below code:
const first = readFileSync('./content/first.txt','utf-8');

But if your first.txt file has too much data in it, it will show you error "variable cannot hold this big data." What to do?
==> USE STREAMS

1) stream.on - to read data in chunks (by default 64kb)
YOU CAN CHANGE THIS 64kb, using highWaterMark

2) highWaterMark: 90000


3) fileStream.pipe => using this, not only you can read data in chunks, you can also write data in chunks.
After using this, in network tab, you will see Transfer-Encoding:chunked
