npm i loadash 
This command installs lodash. 
Lodash has no use in our project. Installed just to show how it can be installed.
Simply using "npm install lodash", like in video 28, gave error "lodash not found". Hence, use command to install Lodash
npm install lodash --save 

Use of .gitIgnore

Push to github

npm i nodemon --save-dev
Run file as soon as you save the change (in project.json)
"scripts": {
   "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  },
!! NODEMON is used when you want to run terminal, as soon as you save app.js !!

Uninstall package
npm uninstall loadash

Package.json -> Why we need this?
There are dependencies. So suppose I want to setup a project in same way as another developer. At that time, I use same version like that person.
Otherwise, app may work in one version, and not on another.
